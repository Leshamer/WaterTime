## Functions

This repository is a one-page website that is designed to allow the user to keep track of how much water they drink.
The page has a description, an indicator of water drunk, and a small field with glasses that can be interacted with. The more glasses selected, the higher the water level will be on the indicator.
You don't have to click on the glasses sequentially, if you click on any glass, all previous glasses will also count as drunk.
Also, when you tap on the indicator, it will fill with water
